#We want to know whether the frost incident can be predicted using a logistic model. We use a binomial model for this case. The frost indcident will be predicted from four parameters, i.e., month, hours, minute, and canopy. Our results indicates the logistic model can only predict 54.9% frost incident with a sensitivy of more than 50%. It indicates the incident can't be predicted using logistic model
